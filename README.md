    * why it is needed
    * briefly describe at concept level how you are going to do it. (if you are implementing it)
* Bug issues must be created before creating a bug branch

* PRs adding functionality should follow the pattern Feature-{New Feature}
* PRs fixing bugs should follow the pattern Bug-{bug being fixed}
* PRs adding robot functionality must be tested on the robot before they can be merged
